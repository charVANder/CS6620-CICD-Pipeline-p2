# CS6620-CICD-Pipeline-p2
This is a HW assignment for CS6620 (Cloud Computing) at the Roux Institute at Northeastern. It is a simple Pokemon-themed REST API built on top of the original Pokemon class from the Part 1 assignment found [here](https://github.com/charVANder/CS6620-CICD-Pipeline-p1). Demonstrates test-driven development, Docker containerization, and CI/CD workflows.
